[{"body":" Preparation Installing TezBake CLI and using it to setup your Tezos baker is very simple. You will need the following tools:\nSpare computer or existing computer with Linux installed. The recommended requirements are provided by Nomadic Labs\n3 CPU cores (arm64 or amd64/x86-64 architectures) – 2 are needed by the Octez node and 1 is needed by the Octez baker; 8GB RAM + 8GB swap (or 16GB RAM); 100GB SSD storage (or similar I/O performance); a low-latency, reliable broadband internet connection. Ledger Nano S Plus or Nano X hardware wallet with Tezos Wallet \u0026 Baker apps installed.\nIt’s necessary to use Ledger Live to install the Tezos Wallet \u0026 Baking applications; to install the latter you must enable developer mode in Ledger Live settings\nAbsolutely ensure you have properly configured the Ledger device settings so the device doesn’t lock 10 minutes after inactivity. This is a common issue that can cause your baker to stop baking.\nRemove the Ledger wallet app from your baking device after you’ve finished setting up your baker. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your baker. You can always reinstall the app when you need to use the Ledger for baking or other purposes.\n🚨 Please note that running a DAL node is now a mandatory requirement for baking on the Tezos network. After completing the instructions here, head over to Baking with DAL to complete the setup.\nWhat is the DAL anyway? The DAL acts like an overflow area for data, where large amounts of information can be kept available to the network without overloading the core blockchain. This means Tezos can safely handle far more transactions and complex operations, because the rollups can rely on the DAL to make their data available for everyone to verify​.\nInstallation Download and copy tezbake To begin, run the script below, which will download the latest version of TezBake and copy it to your /usr/sbin directory. This script works with both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.\nwget -q https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake/raw/main/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh \u0026\u0026 sudo sh /tmp/install.sh # you may be prompted for sudo password Setup Tezos node, signer and install tezbake dependencies tezbake setup # you may be prompted for sudo password Bootstrap Tezos node At this stage, it’s necessary to bootstrap your node, meaning to download a copy of the blockchain so you don’t have to synchronize block-by-block, which takes hours at best.\ntezbake bootstrap-node \u003curl\u003e \u003cblock_hash\u003e # example: tezbake bootstrap-node https://snapshots.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling BL8Vq12HX6MJWkB6RLgQAYRKpKZ5fyMoLpWzAoQ6mh55gkKHiQU Get the block hash and block level from the snapshot provider’s website: https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling.html\nThe \u003cblock_hash\u003e argument is optional but encouraged. If you don’t want to borther with this protection, use the second method below which will also be faster.\nVerify the hash/checksum provided by the snapshot provider to ensure the snapshot is valid. You can find the correct hashes for all blocks on Tezos blockchain explorers such as: https://tzkt.io/blocks https://tzstats.com/\nSimply search for the block level in the search field and verify the hash of the block matches the hash provided by the snapshot provider.\nStart Tezos node After importing the snapshot, you need to start your node and wait until it’s fully synchronized before importing your Ledger key.\ntezbake start After starting the node, run the following command over and over every few minutes and monitor the “level” displayed.\ntezbake info Level refers to the latest block number on mainnet. Navigate to https://tzkt.io or https://tzstats.com and observe the latest block. Once the level in your command matches the latest block on your blockchain explorer, your node is in full sync and you can keep following the steps below.\nBoth https://tzkt.io or https://tzstats.com provide Ghostnet and Testnet block explorers as well. Make sure you’re looking at the right explorer.\nImport Ledger key or soft key and register as baker Now that your node is in full sync, you can proceed with the most important part: (1) your baker parameters import into your baker node and (2) submit your baker registration on the blockchain.\nYou have the option to use the secure Ledger hardware wallet or simply use a local, unencrypted software key (a.k.a. soft key). The secure Ledger hardware wallet is the recommended option for mainnet baking.\nYou will have to first fund your baker address with enough tez (6000 minimum) to cover the bond requirement. You can do this by sending tez from your main account or exchange to the baker address.\n(Option 1 - RECOMMENDED) Import Ledger key to TezBake signer Using a Ledger hardware wallet is a secure and cost effective way to bake on the Tezos network. The Ledger device is a secure element that stores your private key and signs transactions on the device itself. This means your private key never leaves the device and is never exposed to the internet.\nIn order to get the most out of your Ledger, it’s now recommended to use the P-256 curve (tz3) for baking. This curve is faster than the default ed25519 curve (tz1). If you’re setting up a baker that already exists on the network, you can use the same curve as before. If you’re setting up a new baker, it’s recommended to use the P-256 curve.\nYou can import your Ledger key by running the following command:\ntezbake setup-ledger --platform --import-key=\"P-256/0h/0h\" --authorize --hwm 1 If you have a custom derivation path, you can specify it as shown: (--import-key=\"ed25519/0h/0h\"; the default is ed25519/0h/0h which works just fine but is not as fast as P-256 or secp256k1.\n--hwm 1 works great if you’re setting up for the first time. If you’re setting up a device that’s been used to bake before, you want to change this (1) to the current block height on the blockchain for your safety.\nIf you’re importing for the second time after already trying again but failing, you can use --force to force the import.\nOnce imported, you can see your baker address by running tezbake info\nThe ledger will ask you twice to confirm this operation. Make sure the baker you see on the ledger screen matches the one you want to use. If you don’t have this information yet, don’t worry. To get the address of the ledger that’s used by default simply go to https://gov.tez.capital and login with ledger, accepting the default derivation path.\nPutting the baker on a non-default derivation path provides an additional layer of security for your baker at the cost of extra complexity for you. Make sure your setup is clearly documented for your own records.\nIf your device was used to bake before it might have a “high watermark” aka HWM. If you try to use this device on a testnet, it will not work because the block height on test networks usually starts with 1 while mainnet is up to over a couple of million blocks at the time of writing. If you used to bake on mainnet with the same ledger as you’re trying to use now but it’s been a while, it’s highly recommended to change the 1 above to the current block on the network that will be used for the device going forward.\nThe watermark is simply a record of the lack block number your ledger helped to bake or attest. If you’re setting up a brand new device that’s not been used for baking before, there is no need to alter the default command above.\nAlways make sure you’re not accidentally going to double bake by using your production ledger and/or setup to bake on a testnet. It’s really easy to make this mistake and the only thing preventing it are your personal standard operating procedures, the documentation you keep, and the care you take when setting up your baker.\nTo double bake or attest due to baker setup error means having 2 different bakers with the same key on the same network. This is a serious offense and can lead to loss of bond and other penalties. Always double-check your setup and make sure you’re not accidentally double baking or attesting.\n(Option 2 - INSECURE) Import Soft key to TezBake signer First, generate the baker key for TezBake signer:\ntezbake setup-soft-wallet Make sure to backup your key in a secure location and never share it.\nYou can get the secret/private key by running the following command:\ntezbake signer client show address baker --show-secret Register as baker on the Tezos blockchain Mainnet For this step your node level must be synced with the latest block on the blockchain explorer. You must also temporarily open your Ledger Tezos Wallet app to register your key as a baker (note: as well as when voting). For all other baker operations, you must use the Tezos Baking app.\ntezbake register-key Registering is not necessary if this is already an active baker ledger which is being setup on some kind of failover machine or in a situation where it has not been over 2 weeks of baking inactivity.\nRegistering applies to new bakers and to inactive bakers. If you’re setting up a new baker, you must register it. If you’re setting up a baker that’s been inactive for over 2 weeks, you must register it. If you’re setting up a baker that’s been inactive for less than 2 weeks, you don’t need to register it. The best way to find out if you need to register your baker again is to look into your baking rights schedule and see if they stopped coming in. If they did, you need to register your baker again.\nStake your baking XTZ security deposit To bake on the Tezos network, you need to stake your XTZ security deposit. This is a slashable security deposit that you will get back when you stop baking. The minimum bond to get baking rights is currently set at 6000 XTZ.\nYou can stake your security deposit by running the following command, after opening your Ledger Tezos Wallet app:\ntezbake signer client stake 6000 for baker Change 6000 to the amount you want to stake. The minimum is 6000 XTZ. You may start baking with as little as 1000 XTZ but you will need to set your baking over staking multiplier to 5X and secure 5000 XTZ that will stake to your baker to cover the security deposit requirement. You can also secure delegators’ XTZ to your baker to cover the security deposit requirement. Each XTZ delegated to your baker will be counted 0.5 towards the security deposit requirement. For example you can start baking with 1000 XTZ + 5000 XTZ secured from stakers, or you can start baking with 1000 XTZ + 10000 XTZ secured from delegators. You can also start baking with 1000 XTZ + 2000 XTZ secured from stakers + 6000 XTZ secured from delegators.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

This section refers to network parameters to fetch information about the baker in order to compile rewards and payouts - Do not edit unless you are an experienced user Over delegation projection prohibits you from over paying beyond your delegation limit - Do not edit unless you are an experience user This is as basic configuration file for running the TezPay application. The next section will review the advanced configuration file, giving more options and customization to the TezPay application. A user may splice sections from the advanced file to the simple to build a custom file as well - but should be done by experienced users.\nSetup: Step 1b: Configuration File (advanced) This section will review how to setup the configuration file (advanced-version) to be used by the TezPay application.\n*Note: must have file name config.hjson, case-sensitive *\nYellow is areas you will input data/edit fields Blue are comments about Configuration File objects\nThe example below is a more advanced configuration file that showcases several of the features that can be used to customize the TezPay application. To get a simple configuration file, you can remove the sections that are not needed. Here is a sample configuration that will work for 90% of bakers: (TezPay Starter Configuration)[https://docs.tez.capital/tezpay/configuration/examples/starter/]\nPaste your Baker wallet in between the quotes Set your Baker fee (ie 5% = 0.05) Input minimum payout for delegators (ie. 1 = 1 XTZ) Input minimum staking balance for delegators Input delegators wallets that you wish to ignore completely (not often used) Overrides: These will override global settings for delegators - you may delete/remove specific fields where you want to ignore Input wallet address for specific delegator you wish to apply overrides for Input a delegator-specific custom fee (ie 0.5% = 0.005) Input either true or false where true removes the fee from delegator, and false applies the fee specified in the line above Input minimum balance override for specified wallet\\ If you wish to add multiple wallets for over rides, add another wallet following same format keeping the { } to contain the wallet attribute as shown.

Tezos proposal voting The Tezos proposal process consists of 5 stages, each of which lasts for 14 cycles (~14 days). Briefly, the proposal process is as follows:\nProposal. If no proposal gets more than 5% of the state to vote for it, the proposal process repeats indefinitely. As soon as a proposal gets 5% of the state to vote for it, the proposal process moves to the next stage. In cases where there are multiple 5%+ proposals on the table, the proposal with the most votes wins. Exploration Proposal needs to hit quorum (around 50% of all stake voting in some way) and it needs to further hit an acceptance level of 80%+. If it fails to meet these thresholds, the process resets back to the Proposal stage. Cooldown The proposal is tested on a dedicated test network to make sure it migrates and runs. Dapp developers make sure this proposal doesn’t break their dapps. Promotion Proposal needs to hit quorum (around 50% of all stake voting in some way) and it needs to further hit an acceptance level of 80%+. If it fails to meet these thresholds, the process resets back to the Proposal stage. Adoption The proposal is officially accepted and goes into effect at the end of the Adoption stage. The Ghostnet test network is upgraded as a final test before Mainnet adoption. Dapp developers make sure this proposal doesn’t break their dapps and make any necessary changes to their dapps. We recommend you read more about the Tezos Voting process here: https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/voting.html\nProposal voting with TezGov TezGov allows you to participate in Tezos proposal voting with your Ledger hardware wallet.\nWe recommend using a secondary Ledger device with the same seed, to vote with while your primary device is baking. You can also briefly unplug your primary Ledger baking device and use it on a different computer just for voting purposes (use the wallet app to vote), then immediately plugging it back into the primary device, opening the baking app and resuming baking only. If your baking computer itself has a graphical interface, you can briefly switch to the wallet app on your Ledger device and vote, then switch back to the baking app and resume baking only. In order to vote using your Ledger device, you must have the Tezos wallet app installed and open on your Ledger device. If you have the baking app open, you will not be able to vote\nTezGov Web Portal TezGov Web Portal: https://gov.tez.capital\nLog into the TezGov portal by using the most secure method available to you.\nWe highly recommend using the direct Ledger login at the top. This method allows you to see the specific details of your vote on your Ledger screen. Use the Remote (signer) method if you have a signer somewhere on your LAN or local computer. This is an option for advanced users. Use the Beacon method if you are using a Beacon enabled wallet like Temple or Kukai. In this case you will not see the exact details of your vote on your Ledger screen and you will instead be asked to sign an arbitrary blob message. This method also works fine but it is inherently less secure than the direct Ledger method Once logged in you’ll see the TezGov home screen.

Fundamentally speaking, “Baking” on Tezos involves 2 things:\nThe creation of blocks every 10 seconds as well as the attestation of the soundness of blocks produced by other bakers. Bakers put their tez at stake in order to be able to bake blocks and attest other bakers’ blocks. The tez put at stake by the bakers is used as deterrent against bakers acting maliciously. If a baker acts maliciously, they will lose their tez at stake. If a baker acts honestly, they will be rewarded with tez from the protocol. To act maliciously, a baker would have to create a block that is invalid or attest to a block that is invalid.\nParticipating in the Tezos proposal governance process.

It’s a great way to quickly test your baker setup and get familiar with the Tezos baking process. Seoulnet will be removed once the Tallinn upgrade is activated on mainnet. Each protocol upgrade on mainnet usually comes with a new testnet that has the same features and really fast cycles. Ghostnet is the original Tezos testnet. It is a public testnet that is used by developers and users to test new features and applications before they are deployed on the mainnet. Ghostnet is a great way to get familiar with the Tezos ecosystem and to test your applications in a safe environment where the chain conditions are similar to mainnet. Shadownet is similar to Ghostnet but it is a private testnet that is used by developers to test new features and applications before they are deployed on the mainnet. Shadownet is not open to the public and is only accessible to developers who are working on Tezos projects. Shadownet bakers are centrally selected by the core Tezos development team. Setting up a testnet bakery here is possible but not encouraged. Preparation Installing TezBake CLI and using it to setup your Tezos baker is very simple. You will need the following tools:\nSpare computer or existing computer with Linux installed. We recommend Ubuntu Linux.\nYou must have an SSD drive or better \u0026 at least 8GB RAM\nLedger Nano S Plus or Ledger Nano X hardware wallet with Tezos Wallet \u0026 Baker apps installed.\nIt’s necessary to use Ledger Live to install the Tezos Wallet \u0026 Baking applications; to install the latter you must enable developer mode in Ledger Live settings\nAbsolutely ensure you have properly configured the Ledger device settings so the device doesn’t lock 10 minutes after inactivity. This is a common issue that can cause your baker to stop baking.\nRemove the Ledger wallet app from your baking device after you’ve finished setting up your baker. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your baker. You can always reinstall the app when you need to use the Ledger for baking or other purposes.\n🚨 Please note that running a DAL node is now a mandatory requirement for baking on the Tezos network. After completing the instructions here, head over to Baking with DAL to complete the setup.\nWhat is the DAL anyway? The DAL acts like an overflow area for data, where large amounts of information can be kept available to the network without overloading the core blockchain. This means Tezos can safely handle far more transactions and complex operations, because the rollups can rely on the DAL to make their data available for everyone to verify​.\nInstallation Download and copy tezbake To begin, run the script below, which will download the latest version of TezBake and copy it to your /usr/sbin directory. This script works with both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.\nwget -q https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbake/raw/main/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh \u0026\u0026 sudo sh /tmp/install.sh # you may be prompted for sudo password Setup Tezos node, signer and install tezbake dependencies # Seoulnet setup: tezbake setup --node-configuration=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tez-capital/xtz.configs/main/seoulnet.json # Ghostnet setup: tezbake setup --node-configuration=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tez-capital/xtz.configs/main/ghostnet.json # you may be prompted for sudo password Bootstrap Tezos node At this stage, it’s necessary to bootstrap your node, meaning to download a copy of the blockchain so you don’t have to synchronize block-by-block, which takes hours at best.\ntezbake bootstrap-node \u003curl\u003e \u003cblock_hash\u003e # Seoulnet example: tezbake bootstrap-node https://snapshots.tzinit.org/seoulnet/rolling BL8Vq12HX6MJWkB6RLgQAYRKpKZ5fyMoLpWzAoQ6mh55gkKHiQU # Ghostnet example: tezbake bootstrap-node https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/ghostnet/rolling BL8Vq12HX6MJWkB6RLgQAYRKpKZ5fyMoLpWzAoQ6mh55gkKHiQU Get the block hash and block level from the snapshot provider’s website: https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/ghostnet/rolling.html\nThe \u003cblock_hash\u003e argument is optional but encouraged. If you don’t want to borther with this protection, use the second method below which will also be faster.\nVerify the hash/checksum provided by the snapshot provider to ensure the snapshot is valid. You can find the correct hashes for all blocks on Tezos blockchain explorers such as: https://tzkt.io/blocks https://tzstats.com/\nSimply search for the block level in the search field and verify the hash of the block matches the hash provided by the snapshot provider.\nStart Tezos node After importing the snapshot, you need to start your node and wait until it’s fully synchronized before importing your Ledger key.\ntezbake start After starting the node, run the following command over and over every few minutes and monitor the “level” displayed.\ntezbake info Level refers to the latest block number on mainnet. Navigate to https://tzkt.io or https://tzstats.com and observe the latest block. Once the level in your command matches the latest block on your blockchain explorer, your node is in full sync and you can keep following the steps below.\nBoth https://tzkt.io or https://tzstats.com provide Ghostnet and Testnet block explorers as well. Make sure you’re looking at the right explorer.\nImport Ledger key or soft key and register as baker Now that your node is in full sync, you can proceed with the most important part: (1) your baker parameters import into your baker node and (2) submit your baker registration on the blockchain.\nYou have the option to use the secure Ledger hardware wallet or simply use a local, unencrypted software key (a.k.a. soft key). The secure Ledger hardware wallet is the recommended option for mainnet baking.\nYou will have to first fund your baker address with enough tez (6000 minimum) to cover the bond requirement. You can do this by sending tez from your main account or exchange to the baker address.\n(Option 1 - RECOMMENDED) Import Ledger key to TezBake signer Using a Ledger hardware wallet is a secure and cost effective way to bake on the Tezos network. The Ledger device is a secure element that stores your private key and signs transactions on the device itself. This means your private key never leaves the device and is never exposed to the internet.\nIn order to get the most out of your Ledger, it’s now recommended to use the P-256 curve (tz3) for baking. This curve is faster than the default ed25519 curve (tz1). If you’re setting up a baker that already exists on the network, you can use the same curve as before. If you’re setting up a new baker, it’s recommended to use the P-256 curve.\nYou can import your Ledger key by running the following command:\ntezbake setup-ledger --platform --import-key=\"P-256/0h/0h\" --authorize --hwm 1 If you have a custom derivation path, you can specify it as shown: (--import-key=\"ed25519/0h/0h\"; the default is ed25519/0h/0h which works just fine but is not as fast as P-256 or secp256k1.\n--hwm 1 works great if you’re setting up for the first time. If you’re setting up a device that’s been used to bake before, you want to change this (1) to the current block height on the blockchain for your safety.\nIf you’re importing for the second time after already trying again but failing, you can use --force to force the import.\nOnce imported, you can see your baker address by running tezbake info\nThe ledger will ask you twice to confirm this operation. Make sure the baker you see on the ledger screen matches the one you want to use. If you don’t have this information yet, don’t worry. To get the address of the ledger that’s used by default simply go to https://gov.tez.capital and login with ledger, accepting the default derivation path.\nPutting the baker on a non-default derivation path provides an additional layer of security for your baker at the cost of extra complexity for you. Make sure your setup is clearly documented for your own records.\nIf your device was used to bake before it might have a “high watermark” aka HWM. If you try to use this device on a testnet, it will not work because the block height on test networks usually starts with 1 while mainnet is up to over a couple of million blocks at the time of writing. If you used to bake on mainnet with the same ledger as you’re trying to use now but it’s been a while, it’s highly recommended to change the 1 above to the current block on the network that will be used for the device going forward.\nThe watermark is simply a record of the lack block number your ledger helped to bake or attest. If you’re setting up a brand new device that’s not been used for baking before, there is no need to alter the default command above.\nAlways make sure you’re not accidentally going to double bake by using your production ledger and/or setup to bake on a testnet. It’s really easy to make this mistake and the only thing preventing it are your personal standard operating procedures, the documentation you keep, and the care you take when setting up your baker.\nTo double bake or attest due to baker setup error means having 2 different bakers with the same key on the same network. This is a serious offense and can lead to loss of bond and other penalties. Always double-check your setup and make sure you’re not accidentally double baking or attesting.\n(Option 2 - INSECURE) Import Soft key to TezBake signer First, generate the baker key for TezBake signer:\ntezbake setup-soft-wallet Make sure to backup your key in a secure location and never share it.\nYou can get the secret/private key by running the following command:\ntezbake signer client show address baker --show-secret Register as baker on the Tezos blockchain Ghostnet For this step your node level must be synced with the latest block on the blockchain explorer. You must also temporarily open your Ledger Tezos Wallet app to register your key as a baker (note: as well as when voting). For all other baker operations, you must use the Tezos Baking app.\nTo secure your XTZ security deposit on Ghostnet you can use the faucet to get some free XTZ. You can find the faucet at https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/\ntezbake register-key Registering is not necessary if this is already an active baker ledger which is being setup on some kind of failover machine or in a situation where it has not been over 2 weeks of baking inactivity.\nRegistering applies to new bakers and to inactive bakers. If you’re setting up a new baker, you must register it. If you’re setting up a baker that’s been inactive for over 2 weeks, you must register it. If you’re setting up a baker that’s been inactive for less than 2 weeks, you don’t need to register it. The best way to find out if you need to register your baker again is to look into your baking rights schedule and see if they stopped coming in. If they did, you need to register your baker again.\nStake your baking XTZ security deposit To bake on the Tezos network, you need to stake your XTZ security deposit. This is a slashable security deposit that you will get back when you stop baking. The minimum bond to get baking rights is currently set at 6000 XTZ.\nYou can stake your security deposit by running the following command, after opening your Ledger Tezos Wallet app:\ntezbake signer client stake 6000 for baker Change 6000 to the amount you want to stake. The minimum is 6000 XTZ. You may start baking with as little as 1000 XTZ but you will need to set your baking over staking multiplier to 5X and secure 5000 XTZ that will stake to your baker to cover the security deposit requirement. You can also secure delegators’ XTZ to your baker to cover the security deposit requirement. Each XTZ delegated to your baker will be counted 0.5 towards the security deposit requirement. For example you can start baking with 1000 XTZ + 5000 XTZ secured from stakers, or you can start baking with 1000 XTZ + 10000 XTZ secured from delegators. You can also start baking with 1000 XTZ + 2000 XTZ secured from stakers + 6000 XTZ secured from delegators.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

Preparation For this tutorial, you’ll need to have already followed one of the following tutorials:\nHow to Bake How to Bake on Ghostnet A Tezos consensus key is a cryptographic key specifically used for signing blocks and consensus operations (endorsing blocks) in the Tezos blockchain. Introduced to improve security and operational flexibility, it allows bakers (validators) to delegate block-signing responsibilities to a different key than the one associated with their primary baking account.\nThis separation of roles is useful for reducing the exposure of the primary baker key (which holds funds and has broader permissions) by isolating consensus-related tasks to a different key. If compromised, only the consensus operations are affected, not the funds held by the baker’s main account.\nIf an attacker gains control of the consensus key, they can sign blocks and endorse operations. They can maliciously double-bake or double-attest on your behalf, slashing your funds. They can also transfer all baker funds that are not locked/staked in the security deposit by using the drain operation. To eliminate the risk of fund draining by the consensus key, it is recommended to lock/stake all baking funds in the security deposit. It’s further recommended to rotate the consensus key before stopping the baking operations and unstaking the security deposit.\nConsensus key setup Import the consensus key Plug in your consensus key Ledger device and open the Tezos Baking app.\nRun the following command to list the available Ledgers:\ntezbake list-ledgers Note the 4 word ID of the Ledger you want to use for the consensus key.\nRun the following command to import the consensus key:\ntezbake setup-ledger --platform --import-key=\"P-256/0h/0h\" --authorize --ledger-id \"apple-banana-coconut-date\" --hwm 1 --key-alias=consensus Replace the --ledger-id value with the 4 word ID of the Ledger you want to use for the consensus key.\nWe are using the P-256 (tz3) curve for the consensus key because it’s the fastest on Ledger hardware and most portable option with both on premise and cloud hardware security modules (HSMs). The consensus key is only used for signing blocks and endorsements, so it doesn’t need to be the same curve as the baker key. In fact, many bakers move from a tz1 key to a tz3 key for the consensus key to improve performance.\nThis will import your consensus key Ledger device and authorize it for baking. Leave the baking app running on the Ledger device.\nModify the baking configuration Open the TezBake node configuration file:\nnano /bake-buddy/node/app.json Inside the \"configuration\" object, add the following key-value pair:\n\"additional_key_aliases\": [ \"consensus\" ] Here an example of a file with the consensus key alias added:\n{ \"configuration\": { \"BAKER_STARTUP_ARGS\": [ \"--dal-node\", \"http://127.0.0.1:10732/\" ], \"CONFIG_FILE\": { \"p2p\": { \"bootstrap-peers\": [ \"boot.tzbeta.net\" ], \"limits\": { \"connection-timeout\": 10, \"expected-connections\": 40, \"max-connections\": 50, \"max_known_peer_ids\": [ 320, 240 ], \"max_known_points\": [ 320, 240 ], \"min-connections\": 20 }, \"listen-addr\": \"[::]:9732\" }, \"shell\": { \"chain_validator\": { \"synchronisation_threshold\": 6 } } }, \"NODE_TYPE\": \"baker\", \"VOTE_FILE\": { \"adaptive_issuance_vote\": \"on\", \"liquidity_baking_toggle_vote\": \"on\" }, \"additional_key_aliases\": [ \"consensus\" ] }, \"id\": \"bb-default-node\", \"type\": { \"id\": \"xtz.node\", \"version\": \"latest\" }, \"user\": \"bb\" } Re-run the TezBake setup and merge your configuration when asked:\ntezbake stop tezbake setup tezbake start Register the consensus key Get your consensus key public key hash:\ncat /bake-buddy/node/data/.tezos-client/public_keys The public key is the one in the key field.\nAn example of a public key for a tz3 address is p2pk66fWs9UZ6T4nVTfHfV9PtuJje4xYBh2RVo4517a8VTj6Cny7ZXY\nTo register the consensus key, run the following command:\ntezbake signer client set consensus key for baker to consensus You can also set your consensus key on TezGov via https://gov.tez.capital.\nThe new consensus key will become effective after 3 cycles. For example if you set your consensus key in cycle 1000, it will be effective in cycle 1003.\nOnce the consensus Ledger becomes effective, you can unplug your original Ledger device as it’s no longer needed for baking.\nConfirm the consensus key is working Once the consensus key becomes effective, you will see a change in the baking logs by showing the consensus key operating on blocks and endorsements on behalf of the baker key.\nDec 18 05:14:26 bb baker[2428547]: Dec 18 05:14:26.449: injected attestation op5RtCGypnrri9FyYHy91haPWB6CpouxNABcgM7BSUmr81p27G4 for Dec 18 05:14:26 bb baker[2428547]: Dec 18 05:14:26.449: consensus (tz3P9WvzULMuss5iDk4tjNQYWkwSrLAjUuh7) Dec 18 05:14:26 bb baker[2428547]: Dec 18 05:14:26.449: on behalf of tz1S5WxdZR5f9NzsPXhr7L9L1vrEb5spZFur for level 7403648, round Dec 18 05:14:26 bb baker[2428547]: Dec 18 05:14:26.449: 0 To view your baker logs, run the following command:\ntezbake node log baker -f Any questions/comments/concerns?

Introduction The Tezos Data Availability Layer (DAL) enhances network scalability by efficiently handling large volumes of data off-chain, providing essential support for rollups and other layer-2 solutions. This guide explains how to set up DAL locally alongside your TezBake baker.\nFor more details on DAL, see Tezos DAL Overview.\n⚠️ Warning\nThe security implications for bakers in the DAL network are highlighted in the official Octez documentation. Since a baker’s bandwidth in the DAL is proportional to their stake, it may be relatively straightforward to identify the IP address of a DAL node—especially for bakers with substantial stakes.\nTo mitigate this risk, the core team advises running your DAL node on a different IP address than your L1 node. This separation helps prevent unintentional exposure of your node’s identity.\nIf you wish to run TezBake with DAL on a separate machine, consider using TezBake Prism Tunneling, which is designed for setups across multiple hosts.\nNew TezBake Setup with DAL You can set up TezBake with DAL integration from scratch.

To run them at the same time simply combine both configurations in the same file as shown here: https://github.com/tez-capital/tezpeak\nDownload and install TezPeak via TezBake tezbake setup --peak Setup TezPeak configuration cd /bake-buddy/peak/ \u0026\u0026 touch config.hjson Open the config.hjson file with your favorite text editor.\nIf you’ve used json before but now hjson, you can read more about it here: https://hjson.github.io/\nSample TezPeak configuration with 1 baker Here’s an example of a config.hjson file with minimal TezBake configuration for one baker:\n{ listen: 0.0.0.0:8733 app_root: /bake-buddy modules: { tezbake: { bakers: [ tz1S5WxdZR5f9NzsPXhr7L9L1vrEb5spZFur ] } } } You can also make TezPeak GUI only available on the local computer if you have an all-in-one setup (i.e. the baker and the GUI are on the same computer which has a graphical user interface):\n{ listen: 127.0.0.1:8733 app_root: /bake-buddy modules: { tezbake: { bakers: [ tz1S5WxdZR5f9NzsPXhr7L9L1vrEb5spZFur ] } } } Full TezPeak configuration examples Here’s the TezPeak configuration with all TezBake available options:\n{ # Id to show in the header id: \"\" # Address to listen on listen: 127.0.0.1:8733 app_root: /bake-buddy modules: { tezbake: { # uncomment bellow to disable tezbake package monitoring # applications: null bakers: [ # list of bakers to monitor for balances and rights tz1P6WKJu2rcbxKiKRZHKQKmKrpC9TfW1AwM ] } # List of reference nodes to connect to # The reference nodes are used to get the rights and blocks if the baker's node is not available nodes: { \"Tezos Foundation\": { address: https://rpc.tzbeta.net/ is_rights_provider: true is_block_provider: false } tzkt: { address: https://rpc.tzkt.io/mainnet/ is_rights_provider: false is_block_provider: true # reports error if node not available, use for baker's node is_essential: false } } # The mode tezpeak should operate in # auto - if bound to localhost, it will operate in private mode if not, it will operate in public mode # public - assumes public environment, only readonly operations are allowed # private - assumes private environment, all operations are allowed mode: auto } Start TezPeak and connect to it tezbake start --peak If you’re connecting to the TezPeak GUI from a different computer, you’ll need to open a web browser and navigate to http://\u003cyour-baker-ip\u003e:8733.\nIf you’re connecting from the same computer, you can use http://127.0.0.1:8733 or http://localhost:8733.\nTezPeak example screenshot Any questions/comments/concerns?

TezBake Bootstrapping To bootstrap your TezBake node means to download someone else’s snapshot of the blockchain and import it into your node. This is much faster than synchronizing the blockchain from scratch. There is a way to quickly bootstrap your node using a snapshot and a way to bootstrap your node using a snapshot and a block hash. The latter is the most reliable and robust method but it is also the slowest. The former is faster but it assumes you trust the source of the snapshot.\nPlease be aware that bootstrapping your node could result in your nonce revelation to fail and for you to forfit your endorsement rights for the cycle. This is because by default we’re using rolling snapshots which don’t export full blocks for past cycles by default. If your node baked a special kind of block during the last cycle, it may be asked to provide its nonce to the network. To do so, it needs to have the .tezos-client data intact from the last cycle and it needs to have the full blocks for the last cycle.\nTo remedy this situation and to never risk forfitting your endorsement rights for a whole cycle, you have to use a snapshot that’s at least 5-6 days old (from today), when bootstrapping a node. You also have to not wipe out or to move your .tezos-client directory. This way you’ll always have at least 1 cycle+ of full blocks in your node’s database as well as the nonce file on disk. The downside of this method is that it will slow down your bootstrap process by the amount of time it takes to download the full blocks for the past 1 cycle+, which can be up to 2 hours on some slow home networks.\nBootstrap using a snapshot You can get Tezos node snapshots in the following place run by the Tezos Foundation\nhttps://snapshots.tzinit.org/ Before bootstrapping your node, made sure to stop your node as shown below.\nUsing the first bootstrap method below ensures that the snapshot is checked for consistency both programmatically and by your checking the blockchain explorer(s) to confirm the block hash. This is the most reliable and robust method but it it also the slowest.\ntezbake stop tezbake bootstrap-node \u003curl\u003e \u003cblock_hash\u003e tezbake start # example: tezbake bootstrap-node https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling BL8Vq12HX6MJWkB6RLgQAYRKpKZ5fyMoLpWzAoQ6mh55gkKHiQU You can replace eu above with us or asia if you prefer to use a different mirror closer to you.\nGet the block hash and block level from the snapshot provider’s website: https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling.html\nThe \u003cblock_hash\u003e argument is optional but encouraged. If you don’t want to borther with this protection, use the second method below which will also be faster.\nVerify the hash/checksum provided by the snapshot provider to ensure the snapshot is valid. You can find the correct hashes for all blocks on Tezos blockchain explorers such as: https://tzkt.io/blocks https://tzstats.com/\nSimply search for the block level in the search field and verify the hash of the block matches the hash provided by the snapshot provider.\nUsing the second bootstrap method below is faster but it assumes you trust the source of the snapshot. Sometimes one doesn’t have a choice and must make such trade-offs when time is of the essence.\ntezbake stop tezbake bootstrap-node --no-check \u003curl\u003e tezbake start # example: tezbake bootstrap-node --no-check https://snapshots.eu.tzinit.org/mainnet/rolling You can replace eu above with us or asia if you prefer to use a different mirror closer to you.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

If you can estimate the expected duration of a specific test and want to prevent CI from getting stuck, you can use the --timeout=\u003cduration\u003e option to limit how long the instance runs. Supported units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours). In case of a timeout, the container exits with an exit code of 2.\nThe timeout specifies how long the sandbox runs, excluding the bootstrap duration.\nLogs Output from each service are stored in /ascend/logs within the container. To access the logs without entering the container, mount this directory from outside the container.\nTo mount the /ascend/logs directory from inside the container to your host system, use Docker’s -v option to bind mount the directory when running the container.\nHere’s the command format:\ndocker run -it -v /path/on/host:/ascend/logs --entrypoint tezbox ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox For example:\ndocker run -it -v /home/tezos/logs:/ascend/logs --entrypoint tezbox ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox Overrides and configuration through mounted volumes You can override any configuration file by mounting your own file to the /tezbox/overrides directory. The file will be merged with the default configuration. If you want to replace the whole configuration or file without merging, you can mount it to the /tezbox/configuration directory. The configuration is merged with the overrides and the result is stored in the /tezbox/context directory during the initialization of the container.\nArray values are always replaced, not concatenated.\nFor example if you want to adjust block times, you can create sandbox-override-parameters.hjson file with the following content:\nminimal_block_delay: \"1\" // minimal block delay in seconds, has to be quoted Run the container with the following command:\n# sudo docker run -it -v \u003cpath-to-your-file\u003e:/tezbox/overrides/protocols/\u003ccase sensitive protocol id\u003e/sandbox-parameters.hjson ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd)/sandbox-override-parameters.hjson:/tezbox/overrides/protocols/Proxford/sandbox-parameters.hjson ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox You can determine path based on folder structure in https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbox/tree/main/configuration\nOptionally you can mount entire overrides/configuration directory to /tezbox/overrides or /tezbox/configuration to replace the whole configuration.\nsudo docker run -it -v \u003cpath-to-your-configuration-overrides\u003e:/tezbox/overrides ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox Do not edit or mount configuration files in the /tezbox/context directory. They are generated automatically and should not be modified manually.\nAccounts By default tezbox comes with these accounts:\n{ alice: { pkh: tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb pk: edpkvGfYw3LyB1UcCahKQk4rF2tvbMUk8GFiTuMjL75uGXrpvKXhjn sk: unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq balance: 2000000 } bob: { pkh: tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6 pk: edpkurPsQ8eUApnLUJ9ZPDvu98E8VNj4KtJa1aZr16Cr5ow5VHKnz4 sk: unencrypted:edsk3RFfvaFaxbHx8BMtEW1rKQcPtDML3LXjNqMNLCzC3wLC1bWbAt balance: 2000000 } } You can add modify as needed. Just mount your own file to /tezbox/overrides/accounts.hjson for override or /tezbox/configuration/accounts.hjson for full replacement.\nServices You can adjust service behavior by mounting your own configuration to /tezbox/overrides/services/... for override or /tezbox/configuration/services/... for full replacement.\nIf you want to disable a service, you can create override with autostart: false.\nFor example to disable baker service you would crease baker.hjson file:\nautostart: false Mount it into overrides directory:\nsudo docker run -it -v $(pwd)/baker.hjson:/tezbox/overrides/services/baker.hjson ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox Chain Context Chain and protocol is automatically initialized only once during the first run. The chain and all runtime data are stored in /tezbox/context/data directory. If you want to persist your sandbox state just run it with mounted volume to /tezbox/context/data directory.\nsudo docker run -it -v $(pwd)/sandbox-data:/tezbox -p 0.0.0.0:8732:8732 ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox To reset the state you can remove the /tezbox/context/data/tezbox-initialized file. After its removal all chain and client data will be removed and the chain will be reinitialized on the next run.\nFlextesa Compatibility To maintain some level of compatibility with Flextesa, the alice and bob accounts are the same. The RPC port is exposed on ports 8732 and 20000. In addition, TezBox uses similar protocol aliases like oxfordbox and parisbox.\nUnlike Flextesa, TezBox won’t expose configuration through command line arguments. Instead you can edit the configuration directly in the configuration files or use overrides.\nBuilding TezBox To build TezBox follow these steps: clone the repository git clone https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbox \u0026\u0026 cd tezbox edit the Dockerfile, configuration and sources if needed build lua sources (you can get eli from https://github.com/alis-is/eli/releases) eli build/build.lua build the image sudo docker build --build-arg=\"PROTOCOLS=PsParisC\" --build-arg=\"IMAGE_TAG=octez-v20.3\" -t tezbox . -f containers/tezos/Containerfile --no-cache Any questions/comments/concerns?

Baking is suited for individuals at home as well as companies in their on-premise data centers, and cloud providers.\nAt this time the TezBake software focuses on indivudals and companies baking on premise in their homes and own data centers. We do not support baking on cloud providers at this time. We support the most secure on-premise baking method which involves dedicating a small form factor computer to baking with a Ledger Nano S or Nano S Plus hardware wallet as the key storage device. This setup is inexpensive, widely available, and very secure. It does not require a very fast internet connection. It is also very easy to setup and maintain with TezBake.\nThere is never any stake slashing on Tezos in the event of a hardware failure. You will merely not receive rewards for the period of time that the baking computer is down.\nAll blocks that you must bake are scheduled around 5-6 days in advance. You must be operational during the exact times of your block to receive rewards. There is no punishment for missing some of your endorsements as long as you are able to successfully endorse 67% of your endorsements each cycle, every 2.8 days.\nGetting Started ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Getting Started with Tezos Baking Baking on Tezos refers to the act of validating and producing blocks on the Tezos blockchain.

This method allows you to see the specific details of your vote on your Ledger screen. Use the Remote (signer) method if you have a signer somewhere on your LAN or local computer. This is an option for advanced users. Use the Beacon method if you are using a Beacon enabled wallet like Temple or Kukai. In this case you will not see the exact details of your vote on your Ledger screen and you will instead be asked to sign an arbitrary blob message. This method also works fine but it is inherently less secure than the direct Ledger method. Click New Proposal\nYou have 2 options when submitting a proposal via the TezGov portal.\n(1) You can submit a proposal published by the Tezos core developers by pasting its hash The true names of the proposals crafted by the collective Tezos core developer teams are posted in https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/blog.html. Any Tezos baker can submit these proposals to the Tezos blockchain by pasting their hash as shown below. In the example given, the baker is submitting the Nairobi proposal.\n(2) You can submit a message to the Tezos bakers and community in the form of a Tezos proposal hash Vanity names are names crafted for the sole purpose to send a message to all ecosystem participants. They are not meant to be passed during the exploration or adoption phases. Vanity proposals are meant to be used as a way to communicate with the whole Tezos community as a delegate (i.e. baker) on Tezos. In the example given, the baker is submitting a signal that on-chain funding is something desirable.\nVanity proposals can be used for other reasons as well but they are never meant to be pursued all the way through. The scope of vanity proposals does not extend past the proposal round. All bakers must take great care not to vote on these proposals once the governance process enters the exploration phase.\nWe encourage all bakers to use this system only for serious ecosystem governance issues. The governance portal functionality is a two way street. The ability to speak does not absolve a baker from the consequences of the baker’s speech.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

Monitoring TezBake gives you the option to monitor all Tezos node and baking services. TezBake utilizes the journalctl utility included in most Linux distribution to store and manage its logging. You can extract all logs for a node easily to diagnose any issues. This tutorial will walk you through the process of monitoring your TezBake node.\nMonitor overall TezBake status Run this command to get the status of your baker in a snapshot. After first setting up and starting the baker, you may need to give it a minute or 2 before the status display stops changing and missing some information.

The baker process works along with the node process to inject blocks and endorsements into the Tezos network.\nMonitoring just the accuser process shows the attempts of your node to call our double baking events on the Tezos network. Normally you should not see anything in this log.\nMonitor TezBake baker logs for the next protocol During times when Tezos protocol are being switched out you will notice that there is a baker process as well as a baker-next process. The same is true about the accuser process. The baker-next process is the baker process that will be used when the next protocol is activated. The baker process will be used until the next protocol is activated. The accuser-next process is the accuser process that will be used when the next protocol is activated. The accuser process will be used until the next protocol is activated.\ntezbake node log baker-next -f tezbake node log accuser-next -f The baker-next process will show one of two things.\nProtocol is waiting to start. This means everyone is waiting for the new proposal to be activated on mainnet. Nothing needs to be done until the new protocol is activated The baker process is running like normally. This means the new proposal has already activated and the TezBake needs to be updated to reflect it. There is no penalty for not updating unless you do not update in time for the next proposal. In other words, updating is only necessary when a proposal switch is about to happen. We still recommend that all Tezos bakers update their TezBake to the latest production version as soon as possible to get the latest Octez improvements.

The text are configured in the config.json file, however there are preliminary steps needed inorder to be able to utilize these features. This section will review the necessary steps and information needed from platforms that allow for auto-notifications sent via TezPay. This tutorial is meant for individuals that have zero experience with interacting with these systems - feel free to skip sections if you are an advanced user.\nTwitter A Baker can use TezPay to automatically send notifications that payments have been made. This allows for ease of communications for the public baker to the delegates and we will walk through steps to allow for this here. There will be two sections:\n1. Twitter Setup 2. TezPay config.json file setup Twitter Setup In order to setup twitter, be sure you are signed in on a browser window to your twitter account. While being signed into Twitter in a seperate browser, navigate to https://developer.twitter.com/ and select ‘Developer Portal’ in the top menu- the developer portal site where you will set up your development account and get the required information for the config.json file and set up permissions. You will then need to fill in some basic information in order to enable the Development Portal profile to be active. be sure that all of the information is correct (if you use multiple twitter accounts be sure the one you want to enable for notifications is the correct one). Once you submit the information for your development profile - you will need to accept the Terms and Conditions. After accepting Terms and Conditions - you will need to verify your e-mail address that you provided by clicking the link in the e-mail sent from Twitter. Once you verify your email - this will automatically link you back to your Developer Portal Site and prompt you for an ‘App Name’ (see TezPay Notif in screen capture). Once you name your App - you will be given 3 seperate Keys. These will be used to inorder to call the Twitter profile that you are looking to send Notifcations to - and sign for the permissions. Be sure to have these saved in a secure place - they will be used later. Once you have the keys secured, click ‘Dashboard’ button in lower right. You will now be in your Twitter Development Dashboard and see the App you created (for this example TezPayNotifs). Click the ‘gear’ icon to continue set-up. Navigate to ‘User Authentication Settings’ section and click ‘Set-up’ to continue. We will fill out the required items for the form under User Authentication settings as follows: i. App Permissions: Select ‘Read and write’ ii. Type of App: Select ‘Web App, Automated App or Bot’\niii. App Info: a. Callback URI/Redirect URL: this can be anything but for this example we will use ‘https://www.TezPayisthebest.com/'\nb. Website URL: this can be anything but for this example we will use ‘https://www.TezPayisthebest.com/'\niv. Click ‘save’ when finished. You will then get your Client ID and Client Secret - copy and save both of these with your other Keys attained earlier. Click ‘Done’\nThis will bring you back to the main screen of the App - navigate to the ‘Keys and Tokens’ toggle at the top of the page. Now, ‘Generate’ an Access Token and secret - write these down and then once you have confirmed you will be ready to edit the config.json in TezPay. Note - be sure the Access Token and Secret has ‘read and write’ permission (see image below). For the Next step - setting up the config.json - you will need four items:\na. API Key and Secret (also known as Consumer Key/Secret)\nb. Access Token and Secret TezPay config.json Setup for Twitter Notifications We will use the API Key and Secret as well as the Access Token and Secret to edit the Config file to allow for permissions and calls to push notifcations upon each successful payout.\nYou will add the following code block at the base of the config.json file to enable the notifications for TezPay. Note that the message_template can be anything and you can use the , , terms to automatically fill in these terms for each cycle. notifications: [\n{\naccess_token: Your_Acces_Token\naccess_token_secret: Your_Access_Token_Secret\nconsumer_key: Your_Consumer_Key\nconsumer_secret: Your_Consumer_Key_Secret\nmessage_template: Rewards for \u003cCycle\u003e have been paid to \u003cDelegators\u003e delegates in amount of \u003cDistributedRewards\u003e using #TezPay.👀 XTZ baked with #TezBake!

This step will NOT need to be completed every payout, but only when you changes messages to test that it was successful.\nwhile in the tezpay directory, use the command:\n./tezpay test-notify\nUsing TezPay: Step 3 - Initiating a Payout To use the TezPay application to send a payment will require 1 line of code and one additional confirmation while it runs.\nTo run TezPay, run the code:\n./tezpay pay\nThe system will initiate the TezPay application at this point and present a payout table, similar to the table(s) from step 1.\nOnce the table is displayed, the prompt will ask you to confirm the payout, and you need to confirm y or n (see below):\nYou will be asked to confirm, type ‘y’ for yes or ‘n’ for no If you confirm the transaction, the payouts will proceed and your delegates will be paid out, as well as your Baker wallet. Remember, if you are using a separate wallet to payout from your Baker wallet you will need to add funds to cover the payments.\nAt this point you have successfully ran the TezPay application and paid out your delegates. Be sure to check the confirmations and any errors that may have been broadcasted in the terminal (ie, the example above did not send notifications because that was not set up).\nUsing TezPay: Step 4 - Running a Continual Payout To use the TezPay application to send a payment will require 1 line of code and one additional confirmation while it runs.\nTo run TezPay in continual mode, run the command:\n./tezpay continual\nRunning in continual mode will start its first payment a little bit after the current cycle (one during which you launched it) finishes and the next one begins (usually around 30-60 minutes after the beginning of the new cycle).\nIf you would like to start in continual mode but still need to pay your delegators for last cycle, run the command from Step 3. first and then launch TezPay in continual mode.\nSummary: TezPay TezPay is an application that allows for easy payouts for public bakers on the Tezos Blockchain. This allows for significant customizations and flexibility with respect to the payout system and empowers bakers to further take control of their Bakery and aid in decentralizing the Tezos Blockchain.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

The Ledger Nano S works as well but is no longer recommended because it takes up to an extra second (compared to the other ones) for it to sign a block or endorsement. This can cause you to miss a block or endorsement One UPS battery backup (optional) Two computers You will need two computers and both computers will be running TezBake. One computer will be used for baking and the other computer will be used as a backup. A manual failover of the Ledger hardware will be necessary to start baking on the second computer if the first computer fails. The second computer is optional, but it is highly recommended. If you only have one computer, you will need to have a backup plan in place in case the computer fails.\nTwo Ledger Nano S Plus or Nano X While having two computers is somewhat optional, especially for a smaller baker, having two Ledger Nano S Plus or Nano X hardware wallets is very highly recommended. You will need to have two hardware wallets for the following reasons:\nIn the event of Ledger hardware failure To transfer tez to your payment wallet or elsewhere, without interrupting baking To vote on Tezos governance proposals, without interrupting baking Note that you must never simultanerously use two hardware wallets to bake for the same baking address. This will result in a double baking or double endorsing offense and you will be slashed. It’s very easy to avoid by:\nNot authorizing the second hardware wallet to bake for the same address before it’s needed Not importing your baking wallet into your backup computer before it’s needed Before changing any Ledger connections, always ensuring that only one hardware wallet is baking for the address Not installing TezBake on second computer before it’s needed. If you have a fast internet connection, the entire setup process takes just a few minutes. If you only have one hardware wallet and it fails, you will be down until you get a second one and set it up to bake.\nOne UPS battery backup Having at least one UPS device which has your ISP connection and your baking computer connected to it is highly recommended. This will ensure that your baking computer will not be interrupted in the event of electrical failure up to the amount of time supported by your battery. The bigger the battery, the more time your computer will keep baking when power fails.\nIf your baking computer and your ISP are in different rooms or on different electrical outlets, you need to ensure that each one is independently supplied with UPS power.\nBad Practices Using Wi-Fi Using DHCP Using your daily use computer or laptop Not using TezBake Discord or Telegram monitoring bots Using Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is not as realiable as a wired connection and can cause strange and random issues. It is highly recommended that you use a wired connection for your baking computer.\nUsing DHCP DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to your computer. This can cause issues with your baking computer in the event where DHCP is unable to automatically renew its lease. It is highly recommended that you use a static IP address for your baking computer.\nUsing your daily computer or laptop If you use your daily computer for baking, it’s much more likely to have issues because of accidentally affecting either your baker’s connection to the internet or your Ledger’s connection to your baker.\nNot using TezBake Discord or Telegram monitoring bots The TezBake Discord and Telegram bots are designed to monitor your baker’s status and alert you if there are any issues. It is highly recommended that you use these bots to monitor your baker. Should your baker go offline, you will be notified immediately and can take action to fix the issue.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

The only difference is that a public baker has announced themselves to the Tezos community and is willing to accept delegations. A private baker is not willing to accept delegations from delegators. A private baker cannot stop these delegations from occuring but a private baker is not expected to pay out rewards to delegators.\nOn Tezos, bakers (a.k.a. delegates) are paid directly by the blockchain for themselves as well as for their delegators. It’s up to each and every baker to determine their own fee structure and payment policies. It’s also up to each baker as to which payment software they will use to distribute rewards to delegators. There are several different payment software options available to bakers. Some bakers use their own custom software, some bakers use a third party payment software, and some bakers use a combination of both. We recommend using our TezPay payment software. TezPay allows you to fully automate the distribution of rewards to delegators.\nWith the recent introduction of Adaptive Issuance on the Tezos protocol, bakers are now able to accept stakers. Stakers are different from delegators in that:\nStaker tez is frozen for up to 12 days. Stakers are liable for any losses incurred by the baker due to double baking or double endorsing. While rare, this is a risk that stakers take on when they stake their tez with a baker. Stakers are paid directly by the protocol without any need for the baker to pay them, unlike with delegators A public baker has to contact two entities within the Tezos ecosystem to be added to the list of public bakers within each of their ecosystems. The entities in question all have their own methods to determine your public baker details, such as your fee and payment policies, via self-reporting. You will be asked to self-report your details to each of the following entities:\nhttps://tzstats.com (Trilitech) The best place to contact them is: tzstats@trili.tech https://tzkt.io / https://baking-bad.org (Baking Bad) The best places to contact them are: https://t.me/baking_bad_chat and https://discord.gg/aG8XKuwsQd Most wallets and services on Tezos pull their baker information from one of these sources, mostly from TzKT. If you are not listed on TzKT, you will not be listed on most wallets and services on Tezos.\nAny questions/comments/concerns?

DAL on remote\n→ DAL acts as the public Prism endpoint. Node and DAL on separate remotes\n→ Node is the Prism endpoint. Node and DAL on same remote\n→ Same as node on remote; node is the endpoint. Step 1: Choose Your Prism Endpoint In every configuration, you need one “public” Prism endpoint — an app that listens for incoming encrypted Prism traffic.\nLayout Public Prism Endpoint Node on Remote Node DAL on Remote DAL Node \u0026 DAL on Remote Node Node \u0026 DAL on Separate Hosts Node Step 2: Setup Remote Applications Use the tezbake setup command with --remote flags to install apps directly to remote machines.\nExample for DAL:\ntezbake setup --dal \\ --dal-remote user@192.168.1.50:22 \\ --dal-remote-auth key:/path/to/ssh/key \\ --dal-remote-elevate sudo Example for Node:\ntezbake setup --node \\ --node-remote user@192.168.1.60:22 \\ --node-remote-auth key:/path/to/ssh/key Tip: You can combine both in a single command.\nIf you’ve previously installed node or dal locally, remove it first:\ntezbake remove --node --all tezbake remove --dal --all Note: During remote setup, TezBake injects its own SSH keys into the remote machine for secure automation (setup, upgrade, info, etc.).\nStep 3: Edit Application Configurations If Node is Public Prism Endpoint Node’s app.json:\n{ \"configuration\": { # ... \"PRISM\": { \"listen\": \"0.0.0.0:20080\", \"dal\": true, \"signer\": true } # ... } # ... } DAL’s app.json:\n{ \"configuration\": { # ... \"PRISM\": { \"remote\": \"\u003cnode-ip\u003e:20080\", \"node\": true } # ... } # ... } Signer’s app.json:\n{ \"configuration\": { # ... \"PRISM\": { \"remote\": \"\u003cnode-ip\u003e:20080\", \"node\": true } # ... } # ... } If DAL is Public Prism Endpoint DAL’s app.json:\n{ \"configuration\": { # ... \"PRISM\": { \"listen\": \"0.0.0.0:20080\", \"node\": true } # ... } # ... } Node’s app.json:\n{ \"configuration\": { # ... \"PRISM\": { \"dal_remote\": \"\u003cdal-ip\u003e:20080\", \"dal\": true } # ... } # ... } Note: Signer does not require a Prism section in this layout.\nStep 4: Activate Configurations Run:\ntezbake upgrade This will apply your updated app.json configurations and prepare the runtime.\nMake sure UDP port 20080 (or your configured Prism port) is open on the public endpoint.\nStep 5: Generate and Distribute Prism Keys To ensure encrypted and authenticated communication between components, generate a Prism CA and keys on a secure machine — usually the controller/signer host.\nNote: Only applications with a PRISM configuration in their app.json file can generate keys.\nNote: You must generate all .prism keys from the same \u003capp\u003e to ensure compatibility and proper authentication across components. Using different \u003capp\u003e values for key generation can lead to connection failures.\nmkdir -p /bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/ Generate the Certificate Authority:\ntezbake \u003capp\u003e prism generate-ca \\ --output=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/ca Then generate identity keys:\ntezbake \u003capp\u003e prism generate-key \\ --ca=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/ca \\ --name=tezos-node \\ --output=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/node tezbake \u003capp\u003e prism generate-key \\ --ca=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/ca \\ --name=tezos-dal \\ --output=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/dal tezbake \u003capp\u003e prism generate-key \\ --ca=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/ca \\ --name=tezos-signer \\ --output=/bake-buddy/\u003capp\u003e/prism/keys/signer You can validate the keys with:\ntezbake \u003capp\u003e prism key-info --path=\u003ckey\u003e.prism You should see output similar to the following:\nCommon Name: tezos-\u003capp\u003e DNS Names: [tezos-\u003capp\u003e] Extended Key Usage: - Server Authentication - Client Authentication Key Distribution Manually copy the generated .prism keys to the correct app directories:\nKey Destination signer.prism /bake-buddy/signer/prism/keys/signer.prism node.prism /bake-buddy/node/prism/keys/node.prism dal.prism /bake-buddy/dal/prism/keys/dal.prism ⚠️ Do not copy or expose the CA file.\nIf compromised, regenerate all keys with a new CA.\nAfter distributing the keys to their respective locations, you can verify each application’s key information using the following commands:\nFor the Node key:\ntezbake node prism key-info --path=/bake-buddy/node/prism/keys/node.prism For the DAL key:\ntezbake dal prism key-info --path=/bake-buddy/node/prism/keys/dal.prism If the Node is the public Prism endpoint, use this command for the Signer key:\ntezbake signer prism key-info --path=/bake-buddy/node/prism/keys/signer.prism Final Step: Start Everything Once all keys and configs are in place, run:\ntezbake start TezBake will initialize all services and Prism tunnels. You should now have a secure, low-latency connection across your baking infrastructure.\nTroubleshooting Use tezbake info and tezbake \u003capp\u003e log -f prism to diagnose issues. These commands provide valuable insights into the system’s state. If Prism cannot establish a connection, verify that the firewall is not blocking the required port. Ensure that the UDP port (20080 in this guide) is open on the public endpoint — the machine configured with the listen directive under the PRISM section in app.json. If you see the log message failed to verify certificate, it indicates that the certificates are not from the same CA. Use the key-info commands mentioned in the Key Distribution section to verify the keys and ensure they share the same CA field. If everything appears to be working but baking is still not happening, review the certificate’s CN field. Ensure it matches the respective tezos-\u003capp\u003e. For example, for the signer, the CN field should display tezos-signer. Need Help?

Each TezPay instance lives in its own directory and serves one baker address. The folder holds the binary, configuration (config.hjson), and reports. TezPay has an import tool that can convert a standard trd.yaml into a working config.hjson. Note:\nThis is just a quick start guide. For more comprehensive and detailed information about TezPay, you may want to check other guides and the command reference.\nMigration Steps Step 1: Create a TezPay Instance Directory Choose a directory to store your TezPay instance.\nTip:\nUse one folder per baker address, e.g., /tezos/payouts/my-baker.\nThis directory will contain:\ntezpay binary config.hjson (optional) reports/ directory with payout history Step 2: Download TezPay Binary Download the latest binary for your platform from the Releases.\nRename it to tezpay and make it executable (on linux):\nchmod +x ./tezpay For Windows, the binary will be named tezpay.exe. To make it executable, no additional steps are required on Windows.\nNote:\nReplacing the binary with the latest version is how you upgrade TezPay.\nStep 3: Choose Configuration Method You have two options:\nOption A: Migrate from TRD Copy your trd.yaml into the instance folder. Run: ./tezpay import-configuration trd ./trd.yaml This creates config.hjson based on your TRD settings.\nNote:\nMost standard TRD configs work out of the box. Edge cases might need adjustments.\nOption B: Start Fresh Create a file config.hjson in the instance folder. Use this starter template:\nStarter Config For advanced options, refer to:\nSample Config Step 4: Test the Configuration Run a dry run of the payouts:\n./tezpay generate-payouts This does not execute payouts.\nIt only shows what TezPay would distribute.\nStep 5: Execute Payouts Manual Payout Default (last completed cycle): ./tezpay pay Specific cycle: ./tezpay pay -c \u003ccycle number\u003e Automatic (Continual) Payouts To run payouts continuously:\n./tezpay continual Folder Location Tip:\nIf you run TezPay as a service, place your payout folder outside of /home for reliable service access.\nExample: /tezos/payouts/my-baker\nNeed Help?

known as an endorsement) didn’t make it into a block — even though your setup appears to be working fine. This is usually not a problem.\nKey Points:\nTezos is a distributed network; messages can arrive late or out of sync. Block producers are not obligated to include all attestations. If your attestations succeed most of the time, your setup is likely healthy. Why It Happens Attestations have a tight timing window. If your signer’s message arrives just after the block producer includes attestations, it won’t make the cut.\nThink of it like catching a departing elevator — if you’re a second late, the doors close and you’re left behind, even if you were just steps away.\nWhen to Worry Occasional missed attestations are expected. But you should investigate if:\nYou miss frequently You miss multiple in a row Possible causes include:\nYour setup isn’t powerful enough to produce attestations in time Your network connection is unstable (latency spikes or downtime) Your system clock is out of sync What to Check Before assuming something is broken, check the following:\nWas it a broader issue?\nLook up the block in TzKT and see how many attestations were included.\nIf the block was missing a significant portion of attestations (e.g., 1/3), this is more likely a network or block producer issue than a problem with your setup. Example: https://tzkt.io/8830884/operations\nIs your clock synced?\nRun timedatectl status to check your system clock’s synchronization status.\nNote: The command may vary depending on your Linux distribution. Here are some examples:\nFor systems using timedatectl:\ntimedatectl status For systems using chronyc:\nchronyc tracking For systems using ntpq:\nntpq -p Is your setup healthy?\nUse:\ntezbake info\ntezbake node logs -f\ntezbake signer logs -f Look for signs of delay, network errors, or system load.\nSummary Occasional missed attestations are a normal and expected part of Tezos baking. Unless it becomes a trend, there’s no reason to worry.\nLike traffic lights turning red just as you arrive — frustrating, but part of the flow.\nNeed Help?
